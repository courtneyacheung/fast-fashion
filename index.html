            In this project, I explore the questions 
            "What is the relationship between scoial media usage and perception of fast fashion brands?"
            and "What types of social media activity are related to green purchase intention and political consumerism?"

                <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
                <p>
                    Fast fashion can be characterized by fast production of clothing and quick turnaround 
                    for new clothes in order to keep up with demands and trends (Buzzo, A., Abreu, M.J. 2019). 
                    As a result, the clothes are cheaper and more affordable/accessible. 
                    This is enabled by exploitative labor practices in factories, low salaries, and child 
                    labor (an estimated 170 million children are part of the textile labor force according 
                    to UNICEF). In terms of environmental impact, many of the clothes are made with synthetic 
                    materials and plastics that are not biodegradable. Due to the lack of durability 
                    in these clothes, they are then sent to landfills after a short period of time.

                <h2>Social Media</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the 
                    most prominent brands that follow this marketing model are Zara, H&M, and Shein, which has 
                    taken advantage of social media platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok to boost itself to 
                    the position of having the highest market share in fast fashion (Perri, Janine 2023).
                    The conversation on fast fashion and social media usage is becoming 
                    more and more prevalent.

                <p>
                    With fast fashion brands use of marketing 
                    strategies on social media, the appeal of cheap, accessible clothing that stays up to date with the 
                    rapidly changing fashion trends, and the growing conversation on fair labor practices and sustainable 
                    fashion, I am interested to know how consumers of clothing and fashion products end up making purchase 
                    decisions.

                    Prior research related to this topic considers subjects such as marketing, political consumerism,
                    environmental sustainability, labor ethics, and consumer perception. Methods include
                    surveys/questionnaires, data mining, focus groups, interviews, netnographies, and predictive
                    modeling.

                    In this project, I built upon three previous research methods, expanding the survey

            By researching how social media affects consumers' perception of fast fashion brands, 
            their intent to buy sustainable fashion products, and willingness to engage in political consumerism,
            this project contributes to the exploration of the efficacy of individual actions toward
            sustainability, and the need for more systemic regulations.
