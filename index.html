            In this project, I asked the questions: 
            <br>What is the relationship between social media usage and perception of fast fashion brands?
            <br>How does social media usage relate to green purchase intention, and political consumerism?
            <br>What types of social media activities are related to each?

                <h2>What is Fast Fashion?</h2>
                <p>
                    Fast fashion can be characterized by fast production of clothing and quick turnaround 
                    for new clothes in order to keep up with demands and trends (Buzzo, A., Abreu, M.J. 2019). 
                    As a result, the clothes are cheaper and more affordable/accessible. 
                    However, this is enabled by exploitative labor practices in factories, low salaries, and child 
                    labor (an estimated 170 million children are part of the textile labor force according 
                    to UNICEF). In terms of environmental impact, many of the clothes are made with synthetic 
                    materials and plastics that are not biodegradable. Due to the lack of durability 
                    in these clothes, they are then sent to landfills after a short period of time.

                <h2>Social Media</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the 
                    most prominent brands that follow this marketing model are Zara, H&M, and Shein, which has 
                    taken advantage of social media platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok to boost itself to 
                    the position of having the highest market share in fast fashion (Perri, Janine 2023).
                    The conversation on fast fashion and social media usage is becoming 
                    more and more prevalent.

                <p>
                    With fast fashion brands use of marketing 
                    strategies on social media, the appeal of cheap, accessible clothing that stays up to date with the 
                    rapidly changing fashion trends, and the growing conversation on fair labor practices and sustainable 
                    fashion, I am interested to know how consumers of clothing and fashion products end up making purchase 
                    decisions. I am also interested in social media users participation in political consumerism, 
                    “purchasing decisions based on ethical or political considerations 
                    (Stolle et al., 2005)” (de Zúñiga, H. G., Copeland, L., & Bimber, B. 2014).

                    Prior research related to this topic considers subjects such as marketing, political consumerism,
                    environmental sustainability, labor ethics, and consumer perception. Methods include
                    surveys/questionnaires, data mining, focus groups, interviews, netnographies, and predictive
                    modeling. The chart shows some relevant literature and how they are related by citation.

                    Past research has found that social media use mediates the increase in the likelihood of engaging 
                    in political consumerism. 
                    
                    One aspect of this 
                    research to be further studied, is what specific types of social media content and activities are 
                    linked to political consumerism. 
                    
                    Other research has examined “consumers' green product purchasing 
                    intentions and observed how social media marketing (SMM) and social media usage (SMU) actively influence 
                    consumers' sustainable consumption behavior”, finding that social media marketing has a strong positive 
                    correlation with intention to purchase green products on social media (Nekmahmud, Md., Naz, F., Ramkissoon, 
                    H, Fekete-Farkas, M 2022).

                    In this project, I built upon two of the research papers as suggested.

                    Further analysis using my collected data would include grouping by demographic and exporing
                    what types of social media content are related to each dependent variable.

                    Other suggested avenue for further research I did not get is to assess other constructs such as brand image, and 
                    the “role of social media influencers and celebrities in influencing the attitude of consumers toward green products”.

            By researching how social media affects consumers' perception of fast fashion brands, 
            their intent to buy sustainable fashion products, and willingness to engage in political consumerism,
            this project contributes to the exploration of the efficacy of individual actions toward
            sustainability, and the need for more systemic regulations.
